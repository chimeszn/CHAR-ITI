# CHAR-ITI

This is a Webpage design made by Oluchime Promise as a requirement for graduation from the ALX School of Software Engineering

* Char-Iti is a functional website designed to showcase charitable campaigns as well as offer a platform for donation to those causes

## DESCRIPTION ##

This project is to be created with the intent of establishing an easy to use website for a charitable organization, in order to showcase their charitable works, get people to sign up as users on their platform either as people who need help or those who want to help, and also create an organised structure for filtering payments and collating the data of users in one platform.

The project will not solve a lot of things, but will create a platform where most things like world hunger, and poverty can be solved in a modern and digital way.

The project isnâ€™t just restricted to a certain community, but a global one where anyone can be a part of doing something good in the world.

My role is to create the front-end part of the project, design a payment structure, as well as create a database management system to collect the data of the users who sign up and/or donate.
