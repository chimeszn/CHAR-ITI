 <h1> About CHAR-ITI </h1>
 <br>
 <p> While we do our good works, let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity would have become unnecessary. </p>
 <p> This in turn defines what we do as an organization. We are a platform designed to connect you with charitable causes in the world.</p>
 <p> Join us as we solve the world's problems; one child, one man, and one woman at a time.</p>
